# Architectural Decision Records

An ADR records a decision that is expensive to reverse, the context it was made in, and what it
costs us. They are written for whoever reads this codebase in six months — possibly us.

# ADR-000N — Title

- **Status:** Accepted | Proposed | Superseded by ADR-000M
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Related:** files, defects, roadmap milestone

## Context

What forces are at play, including the constraint that made this a decision rather than a default.

## Decision

What we are doing, in the present tense.

## Consequences

### Positive

### Negative / costs

What we are accepting in exchange. An ADR with no costs listed has not been thought through.

## Alternatives considered

Each with the reason it was rejected.

## Enforcement

How the decision is kept true — a test, a lint rule, a CI check, or "review only" with the reason.
```

## Conventions

- One decision per record. If a record needs "and", it is two records.
- ADRs are immutable once Accepted. A changed decision gets a new ADR that supersedes the old one;
  the old one's status is updated to point at it.
- Anything that changes a decision must update or add an ADR in the same change.
- "Enforcement: review only" is allowed, but it must say why no test can hold the line.
